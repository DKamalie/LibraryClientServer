Using the client server library application 
1) Clone the repository
2) Open both the LibraryClient project and the LibraryServer project
3) Inside the LibraryServer project, find the 'cput.libraryServer' package which is located in the Source Packages. Once located, open the LibraryServer.java class. Once entered, build and run it.
4) After running the server, open the LibraryClient and locate the 'views' package. Once located, click on the 'Main.java' class, and again, build and run it. 
5) At this point the Graphical User Interface should pop up 
 
Checking the database 
The program uses a derby database which can be found under services in Netbeans. All entered information will show up in the tables that reside within the database.

Thank you for using my program.
